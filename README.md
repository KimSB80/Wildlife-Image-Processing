## Problem Statement
Camera traps, also known as game cameras, are an important tool for monitoring wildlife populations for conservation and management purposes. The cameras allow for wildlife data to be collected with minimal human disturbance, yielding more accurate data for species presence and interactions. Camera traps produce an enormous number of images, and sifting through these images to identify individual species can be time consuming and tedious. Training machine learning models to identify wildlife in camera trap images can therefore save companies an enormous amount of time and resources. 

## Data Collection
The general focus of this project was to use deep learning to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) model that can accurately predict the animal species in a camera trap image. While camera traps are used for all types of wildlife, monitoring bird populations can be particularly challenging, since they are more difficult to capture and track than other terrestrial animals. For this project, I used a [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akash2907/bird-species-classification) containing images of 16 common Himalayan birds.
